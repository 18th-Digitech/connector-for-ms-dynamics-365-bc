## ⚠️ Important -- Product Attribute Configuration

     
PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE_CODE = <attribute_code>$<attribute_name>$<attribute_type>,

Each entry consists of three components: the unique attribute code (which serves as the system identifier), the display name as shown in the Admin interface, and the attribute type. The attribute types can include text (for text input), decimal (for numeric values with decimals), boolean (for yes or no options), option (for a single-select dropdown), or multiselect (for multiple selectable options). For example, the format would be: PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE_CODE=uom$UOM$option


## ⚠️ Important -- Onboarding Required Before Deployment

Before deploying the app, you must manually run:

``` bash
npm run onboard
```

If this step is skipped, the post-deploy script may fail.

### Configure Cron Job Schedule
 
  You have the flexibility to set the cron job schedule time in the `app.config.yaml` file to suit your needs perfectly. If you'd like to ensure that the instructions for the cron job schedule in the help guide are up-to-date, you can easily make those updates at the specified path

 ```bash
 web-src/src/components/UserGuideTab.js
 ```



After onboarding, deploy the application using:

``` bash
aio app deploy
```
